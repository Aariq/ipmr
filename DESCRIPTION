Description: Flexibly implements IPMs using an expression based framework. This
  will not abstract away the model selection process, but it will make sure you
  get everything after that correct. It handles density dependence and environmental
  stochasticity, with a couple of options for implementing the latter. Additionally,
  provides model diagnostic tools, plotting functionality, stochastic/deterministic
  simulations, and analysis tools.
