# ipmr

`ipmr` is a package for implementing Integral Projection Models (IPMs) in _R_. It relies heavily on the mathematical syntax of the models, and does not try to abstract over the process of fitting vital rates. It is still very much a work in progress, and so models implemented using current code may not run in the not-so-distant future as more complicated methods are brought online and tweaks are made. Below is a brief overview of how `ipmr` classifies different model types followed by examples of how to implement those types in this framework. 

## Installation

`ipmr` is not yet on CRAN. You can install the development version with the snippet below:

```{r eval = FALSE}

if(!require('remotes', quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github("levisc8/ipmr", build_vignettes = TRUE)

```

## Package scope

Note that this package **will not** help with the process of fitting vital rate models at all! That is a sufficiently different (and vast) question that we decided it was not within the scope of this project. This will only help you turn those regression models into an IPM without shooting yourself in the foot. Thus, everything that follows assumes you have parameterized those vital rate models and are now ready to begin implementing your model. 

Below is a brief overview of the package and some examples of how to implement models with it.

## Model classes

Once all parameters are estimated, the first step of defining a model in `ipmr` is to initialize the model using `init_ipm()`. This function has two arguments: `model_class`, and `has_age`. We will ignore `has_age` for now, because age-size models are a complicated topic and have their [own vignette](https://levisc8.github.io/ipmr/articles/age_x_size.html).

The `model_class` defines the basic infrastructure that will be available for subsequent analyses and helps make sure the kernels are correctly implemented from the underlying vital rates. `model_class` should be a character string with at least 3 (but possibly 4) entries separated by underscores (`_`). The possible entries for each position are:


- Position 1: `"simple"`/`"general"`

    + A. **simple**: This describes an IPM with a single continuous state variable and no discrete stages. 

    + B. **general**: This describes and IPM with either more than one continuous state variable, one or more discrete stages, or both of the above. Basically, anything other than an IPM with a single continuous state variable.

- Position 2: `"di"`/`"dd"`

    + A. **di**: This is used to denote a density-independent IPM.

    + B. **dd**: This is used to denote a density-dependent IPM.

- Position 3: `"det"`/`"stoch"`

    + A. **det**: This is used to denote a deterministic IPM. If this is used in the third position of `model_class`, there should not be a fourth entry.

    + B. **stoch**: This is used to denote a stochastic IPM. If this is used in the third position of `model_class`, there should always be a fourth entry. The two possibilities for the fourth are described next.

- Position 4: `"kern"`/`"param"` (Complete definitions found in [Metcalf et al. 2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12405))

    + A. **kern**: This describes an IPM with discretely varying parameters such that their values are known before the model is specified. This is usually the case with models that estimate fixed and/or random year/site effects and for which defining a multivariate joint distribution to sample parameters from is not desirable/needed. These models can be a bit more computationally efficient than the `param` alternative because all kernels can be constructed before the iteration procedure begins, as opposed to requiring reconstruction for every single iteration. 

    + B. **param**: This describes an IPM with parameters that are re-sampled from some distribution at each iteration of the model (usually a multivariate joint distribution). This can be a multivariate normal defined by covarying slopes and intercepts, or posterior distribution from a Bayesian model. All that is required is that the parameters for the distribution are specified and that the function that generates the parameters at each iteration returns named lists that correspond to the parameter names in the model. Jump down to the `"simple_di_stoch_param"` example for some inspiration in writing those.

With the type of model selected, the `model_class` becomes a string and the call to `init_ipm` is composed like so: `init_ipm(model_class = "position1_position_2_position3_position4")`. 

The following possibilities are currently or will become available in `ipmr` (bold text denotes development progress):

- Simple, density independent models: **Completed and ready**

1. `"simple_di_det"`

2. `"simple_di_stoch_kern"`

3. `"simple_di_stoch_param"`

- Simple, density dependent models: **Completed, likely stable**

4. `"simple_dd_det"`

5. `"simple_dd_stoch_kern"`

6. `"simple_dd_stoch_param"`

- General, density independent models: **Completed and ready**

7. `"general_di_det"`

8. `"general_di_stoch_kern"`

9. `"general_di_stoch_param"`

-
General, density dependent models: **Completed, likely stable**

10. `"general_dd_det"`

11. `"general_dd_stoch_kern"`

12. `"general_dd_stoch_param"`


Simple density-independent deterministic, simple kernel-resampled stochastic, and simple parameter resampled stochastic models (`simple_di_det`, `simple_di_stoch_kern`, `simple_di_stoch_param`) are functional and detailed below as well as [here](https://levisc8.github.io/ipmr/articles/ipmr-introduction.html). The `general_*` versions of these are also ready, and an introduction to them is available [here](https://levisc8.github.io/ipmr/articles/general-ipms.html). Density dependent versions are completed for simple and general models, and are probably stable, but have not been tested enough to be certain.

Keep reading below for examples of how to implement various IPMs in this framework.

## Examples for simple IPM classes

Here is a simple model implemented with `ipmr`. It will use the following set of linear models:

1. Survival (`s`): a generalized linear model w/ a logit link.

    - Example model formula: `glm(surv ~ size_1, data = my_surv_data, family = binomial())`
    

2. Growth (`g`): a linear model with a Normal error distribution.

    - Example model formula: `lm(size_2 ~ size_1, data = my_grow_data)`
    

3. Pr(flowering) (`f_r`): a generalized linear model w/ a logit link.

    - Example model formula: `glm(flower ~ size_1, data = my_repro_data, family = binomial())`
    

4. Seed production (`f_s`): a generalized linear model w/ log link.

    - Example model formula: `glm(seeds ~ size_1, data = my_flower_data, family = poisson())`
    

5. Recruit size distribution (`f_d`): a normal distribution w parameters `mu_fd` (mean) and `sd_fd` (standard deviation).

The example below assumes we've already fit our vital rate models from the raw data. In this example, the numbers are made up, but code that extracts the values you need from a real regression model is provided in comments.

A more detailed introduction to `ipmr` is available in the Intro to ipmr article on this page. General IPM (ones with multiple continuous and/or discrete states) tutorials are also available there under the General IPMs article. That's all for now, happy modelling!
