## Generic implementation progress 

Below is a table indicating which methods are implemented for each class defined in `ipmr`. If the column has an "X" in it, that means it is ready. Some methods don't apply to certain types (i.e. `make_ipm()` for IPMs that have already been built).


```{r echo = FALSE}

library(tibble)
library(kableExtra)

tab <- read.csv("../paper/generic_progress.csv",
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  .[-c(1, 8), ] %>% 
  as_tibble()


kab <- knitr::kable(tab,
                    format = 'html',
                    aligh = paste(c('l', rep('c', 7)), collapse = "")) %>%
  kable_styling(
    fixed_thead = TRUE
    
  ) %>%
  add_header_above(c(' ', "Function" = 7)) %>%
  pack_rows(
    'proto_ipm', 1, 6
  ) %>%
  pack_rows(
    'ipm', 7, 12 
  ) %>%
  column_spec(1:7,
              border_left = TRUE,
              border_right = TRUE)

print(kab)


```
