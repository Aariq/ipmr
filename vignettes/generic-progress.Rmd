## Generic implementation progress 

Below is a table indicating which methods are implemented for each class defined in `ipmr`. If the column has an "X" in it, that means it is ready. Some methods don't apply to certain types (i.e. `make_ipm()` for IPMs that have already been built).


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(tibble)
library(kableExtra)

tab <- read.csv("../paper/generic_progress.csv",
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  .[-c(1, 8), ] %>% 
  as_tibble()

tab$Model[7:12] <- paste(tab$Model[7:12], "_ipm", sep = "")


knitr::kable(tab,
             format = 'pandoc',
             align = paste(c('l', rep('c', 7)), collapse = "")) 


```
